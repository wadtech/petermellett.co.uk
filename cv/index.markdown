**Open Source**

I'm a keen open source contributor and try to regularly contribute to projects I use and admire. An example of projects I've contributed to:

[24PullRequests](https://24pullrequests.com) - "Give little gifts of code for Christmas" encouraging participation in open source contributing and supporting the maintainers of some of the software many of us take for granted.

[canned](https://github.com/sideshowcoder/canned) - File-based canned responses for JSON APIs. I've used this extensively for a project and have tried to return the favour with some contributions.
