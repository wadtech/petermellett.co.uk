## Mission To Mars

[Website](https://www.softwarecornwall.org/category/education-outreach/mission-to-mars/)

Mentored a work experience week with young people (aged 14-18) who are interested in technology fields. The week offers a chance to experience agile methodologies and software development practices using Arduino-powered robots designed to emulate Mars rovers.

The students learn to complete user stories, create and test acceptance criteria and manage team budget and burndown using purpose-built dashboard software.
