[Cornwall Ruby](https://cornwallruby.co.uk) is the RUG I've set up to find other like-minded developers and interested amateurs in the county.

We use Slack for our normal chat and arrange semi-regular meetups.

If you'd like to get involved don't hesitate to join us. Everyone is welcome regardless of ability or level of interest - it's always nice to meet someone with a shared interest!
